# pexlechris-save-active-plugins

Have you ever been in a situation where you needed to disable all active plugins and re-enable them one by one to identify which plugin is causing the bug?

You start by disabling all plugins, but when itâ€™s time to re-enable them one by one, do you struggle to remember which plugins were originally active?

This lightweight plugin can help you!

Here, you can find the GitHub repository for this plugin. Download it easily by clicking the green 'Code' button and selecting 'Download ZIP'.


- Before starting debugging, simply click the 'Save Fav Plugins' button in the admin toolbar at the top.
- A plugin category (or status) will be created, and only currently active plugins will be added to this list.
- A heart icon will appear next to the plugins that have been added.

Now, when you are called to re-enable the plugins one by one, you'll know which plugin is active!
